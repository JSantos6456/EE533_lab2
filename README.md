EE533 Lab 2: 32-bit ALU Design
Justin Santos

Folder Descriptions

Schematic_proj: Includes schematics, symbols, testbenches of all building block units (i.e. 1-bit adder, 8-bit adder, 32-bit adder, 32-bit ALU functions), and Map Logger File after implementation.

Verilog_proj: Includes module designs of 32-bit adder/subtracter, logic unit, right shifter, and 32-bit ALU. Also includes testbenches and Map Logger file after implementation.
